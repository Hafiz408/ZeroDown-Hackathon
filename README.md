## US Housing Market Dynamics analysis and dashboard.

This repo is about "US House Marketing Dynamics" for which I first preprocessed the dataset by removing the features with most null values, filtering out the columns that are used, replacing the null values in the remaining columns with relevant values and then creating new columns from already exixting ones for easier analysis. Further, few basic plots where done in the colab. Since, colab wasn't able to load the whole dataset, I used main.py file to preprocess and save the preprocessed dataset locally. This preprocessed dataset was imported into tableau were various specific charts, trends and forecasts was plotted using which dashboard was created. This was uploaded in tableau public using which a simple html page was developed to display it. This dashboard contains various filters such as year, month, region type, state, etc using which we can further get a detailed and focused view on insights. The link to the dataset, tableau public and html page hosted in GitHub pages can be found below.
